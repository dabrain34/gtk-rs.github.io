It time again for a new gtk-rs release!

If you have been watching our crates on crates.io closely or if you have attended GUADEC you may already have noticed that we have released new versions of the gtk-rs crates.

The new versions contain less breaking changes than some of our previous releases, so updating will be easier. The release however does include some nice improvements that can simplify your application as well as support the latest API additions of the underlying libraries.

As anticipated in the previous release, this will likely be the last release of the gtk3-rs bindings and we recommend to everyone to upgrade to GTK4. If you require gtk3-rs to keep up with new versions of gtk-rs-core please consider volunteering to help with maintenance of the project.

## Increase of the minimum supported Rust version (MSRV)

With this release, Rust 1.70 is the minimum version required to compile and use the bindings.

## gtk-rs-core

### New `glib::derived_properties` macro

With the `glib::Properties` derive macro added in the last release, you still had to write these blanket functions manually

```rust
impl ObjectImpl for T {
    fn properties() -> &'static [glib::ParamSpec] {
        Self::derived_properties()
    }
    fn set_property(&self, id: usize, value: &glib::Value, pspec: &glib::ParamSpec) {
        self.derived_set_property(id, value, pspec)
    }
    fn property(&self, id: usize, pspec: &glib::ParamSpec) -> glib::Value {
        self.derived_property(id, pspec)
    }
}
```

Now you can replace that code with

```rust
#[glib::derived_properties]
impl ObjectImpl for T {}
```

### Replacement of `glib::Continue` / `glib::Inhibit`

These two types were a bit difficult to understand, as you had to pass a boolean `glib::Continue(true)` /  `glib::Inhibit(false)`. We replaced them with new enums

```rust
glib::Continue(true) -> glib::ControlFlow::Continue
glib::Continue(false) -> glib::ControlFlow::Break
glib::Inhibit(true) -> glib::Propagation::Stop
glib::Inhibit(false) -> glib::Propagation::Proceed
```

Making the meaning of each value clearer to the developer. This should be the most annoying change you need to do during the update to this release.

### Typed constructors

In the past we had a bunch of constructors taking `glib::Type` as a parameter instead of `T: impl StaticType` / `T: impl IsA<O>`. For this release, we cleaned up several of those constructors.

```rust
let model = gio::ListStore::new(SomeObject::static_type()); // before
let model = gio::ListStore::new::<SomeObject>(); // after
let model = gio::ListStore::with_type(SomeObject::static_type()); // is available for specific use cases
```

Changed constructors:

- `glib::SignalGroup`
- `glib::FlagsClass`
- `glib::EnumClass`

### New `glib::ValueDelegate`` macro

Let's say you want to create a wrapper around some type, but you want to retain `ToValue`, `FromValue`, and `HasParamSpec` implementations, which are especially necessary when you want to use an object as a property. This is where the `glib::ValueDelegate` macro comes in. Instead of having to manually implement the following:

```rust
pub struct Uid(String);

impl glib::types::StaticType for Uid {
    fn static_type() -> glib::types::Type {
        <String as glib::types::StaticType>::static_type()
    }
}

impl glib::value::ToValue for Uid {
    fn to_value(&self) -> glib::value::Value {
        glib::value::ToValue::to_value(&self.0)
    }

    fn value_type(&self) -> glib::types::Type {
        glib::value::ToValue::value_type(&self.0)
    }
}

impl From<Uid> for glib::value::Value {
    fn from(uid: Uid) -> Self {
        glib::value::Value::from(uid.0)
    }
}

unsafe impl<'a> glib::value::FromValue<'a> for Uid {
    type Checker = <String as glib::value::FromValue<'a>>::Checker;
    unsafe fn from_value(value: &'a glib::value::Value) -> Self {
        Uid(<String as glib::value::FromValue<'a>>::from_value(value))
    }
}

impl glib::HasParamSpec for Uid {
    type ParamSpec = <String as glib::HasParamSpec>::ParamSpec;
    type SetValue = Self;
    type BuilderFn = <String as glib::HasParamSpec>::BuilderFn;
    fn param_spec_builder() -> Self::BuilderFn {
        <String as glib::HasParamSpec>::param_spec_builder()
    }
}
```

you can simply use the macro as follows:

```rust
#[derive(glib::ValueDelegate)]
pub struct Uid(String);
```

For more complex cases, see the documentation.

You could also achieve the same by using `glib::Boxed`, but `glib::ValueDelegate` provides a thinner wrapper as it only calls to the inner implementation instead of using [`GBoxed`](https://docs.gtk.org/gobject/boxed.html). Additionally, `glib::ValueDelegate` propagates the `GType`` to the wrapper instead of creating a new type.

### Various `glib::Properties` improvements

TODO

## gtk4-rs

The bindings now support GTK 4.12 with `v4_12` feature flag. Other than that they didn't see many user facing changes. The development mainly focused on various cleanups and bug fixes.

### Blueprint support in `gtk::CompositeTemplate`

You can now use [blueprint](https://jwestman.pages.gitlab.gnome.org/blueprint-compiler/) with both `string` and `file` attributes of the `gtk::CompositeTemplate` macro. This requires having the `blueprint-compiler` binary installed.

```rust
use gtk::{glib, prelude::*, subclass::prelude::*};

mod imp {
    use super::*;

    #[derive(Debug, Default, gtk::CompositeTemplate)]
    #[template(string = "
    template MyWidget : Widget {
        Label label {
            label: 'foobar';
        }

        Label my_label2 {
            label: 'foobaz';
        }
    }
    ")]
    pub struct MyWidget {
        #[template_child]
        pub label: TemplateChild<gtk::Label>,
        #[template_child(id = "my_label2")]
        pub label2: gtk::TemplateChild<gtk::Label>,
    }

    #[glib::object_subclass]
    impl ObjectSubclass for MyWidget {
        const NAME: &'static str = "MyWidget";
        type Type = super::MyWidget;
        type ParentType = gtk::Widget;
        fn class_init(klass: &mut Self::Class) {
            klass.bind_template();
        }
        fn instance_init(obj: &glib::subclass::InitializingObject<Self>) {
            obj.init_template();
        }
    }

    impl ObjectImpl for MyWidget {
        fn dispose(&self) {
            while let Some(child) = self.obj().first_child() {
                child.unparent();
            }
        }
    }
    impl WidgetImpl for MyWidget {}
}

glib::wrapper! {
    pub struct MyWidget(ObjectSubclass<imp::MyWidget>) @extends gtk::Widget;
}
```

### Stop using deprecated StyleContext APIs

The `gtk::StyleContext::add_provider_for_display` / `gtk::StyleContext::remove_provider_for_display` functions were never supposed to be part of the `gtk::StyleContext` type. Since that type was deprecated upstream in GTK 4.10, the developers now annoyingly had to use `#[allow(deprecated)]`, even though those two functions were not deprecated at all.

We have added `gtk::style_context_add_provider_for_display` / `gtk::style_context_remove_provider_for_display` as a replacement for them.
